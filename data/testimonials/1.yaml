text: "I have brought in Testloop to two different organisations and I’m always impressed with the consistency and effectiveness of their consultants. Danny Hall, who worked with us at SpareRoom and Carnect, is the best Software Engineer in Test I’ve ever had the pleasure to work with. He is also a very effective leader of cultural change, helping both organisations and individuals move towards a test led approach to development. His calm and effective manner, mixed with a very deep and intricate understanding of the way to apply techniques such as Behaviour Driven Development, is quite inspiring to watch."
